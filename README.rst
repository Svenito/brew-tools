Installation
============

Brew-tools is available from PyPI

::

    pip install brew-tools

You can also clone/download this repository and install it using pip

::

    cd <brew-tools-dir>
    pip install .

Usage
=====

When first starting Brew tools you will be asked for your preferred unit type, metric or imperial.
This is then stored in a config file and used as the default unit. This can be temporarily
changed with the `--unit` option.

    dme

and also for its commands

::

    brew-tools infuse --help
    Usage: brew-tools infuse [OPTIONS]

    Options:
      -temp FLOAT    Current temperature of mash
      -target FLOAT  Target temperature of mash
      -ratio FLOAT   Grist/water ratio
      -grain FLOAT   Weight of grain in mash
      -water FLOAT   Temp of infusion water
      --help         Show this message and exit.

If the inputs are not passed via the command line arguments, brew tools
will prompt the user for input.

`documentation <https://brew-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__

Development
===========
If you want to help develop brew tools you should install it into a
virtual environment. The current version of brew-tools uses [Poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/)
to manage virtual environments and such.

In order to start, [install Poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/docs/#installation)
and change into the brew-tools directory. From there you can run

::

    poetry install

which will create a virtual environment and install the dependencies.
To run `brew_tools` in the developmeent environment it's probably easiest to run

::

    poetry shell

which will spawn a configured shell for the environment.

Tests can be run in this environment, or you can use

::

   poetry run pytest tests

to run the tests without spawning a shell.

In addition to the tests it's advisable to run a linter of the source as Travis
will also check for linting errors. The linter command ignores some errors, so you
can use this command to match the command run by Travis

::

    poetry run flake8 src --ignore=E501,W504,W503
