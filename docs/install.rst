==================
Install Brew Tools
==================

Use pip

.. code::

    pip install brew-tools

then run with `brew_tools`

If you are planning to work on it, you can use `poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`_ to install it once you've cloned the project

.. code:: bash

    $> git clone git@github.com:Svenito/brew-tools.git
    $> cd brew-tools
    $> poetry shell
    $> poetry install

Alternatively you can use the virtualenv and local install method too.
